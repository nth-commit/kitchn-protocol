# Kitchn Protocol

An entirely on-chain protocol for scheduling and executing async work. Set & forget; surface automation as an expense of your protocol and integrate Kitchn with your your tokenomics => run your automation forever, no ops required!

Like [Gelato](https://docs.gelato.network/introduction/what-is-gelato) but decentralization is built in from the ground up:

- No opaque/private worker networks
- Owned and governed by the users
- Immutable API, zero-trust compatibility - forever

_... from day zero._
